## Topics

-   Overdispersion via random effects

-   What about REML?

-   Residuals

-   So is the Laplace approximation working?

## Overdispersion via random effects

-   For distributions where variance cannot be controlled separately from mean (e.g., Poisson, multinomial)
    -   Treat parameters of these distributions as random
-   New probability distributions have been defined this way.
    -   E.g., the NB (Poisson, gamma rate parameter), Dirichlet-multinomial (multinomial, p vector Dirichlet)
    -   Compound pdf found by integrating the joint likelihood
-   Alternatively could specify observation-specific random effects. E.g., Poisson with log of rate normal (this is GLMM, with log link function) - Easy to generalize using RTMB.

## REML

-   ML variance estimates are known to be biased

-   REML variance estimates are unbiased in linear normal models and generally less biased than ML estimates

-   REML estimates can be obtained by declaring all the fixed effects other than the variances as random (don't add anything to the function you minimize)

-   Pretty much ignored and not studied/evaluated in stock assessment

## Residuals

-   standard Pearson residuals

-   Problems with standard Pearson residuals

-   One step ahead (osa) aka recursive quantile residuals

## Pearson residuals

-   defined as (obs-pred)/sd

-   sd is what the standard deviation for (obs-pred) should be given your model and model estimates

-   Idea is that if raw residuals are approximately normal and independent then Pearson residuals will be approximately normal, independent, with equal (1) variance.

    -   So all the residuals can be looked at together

## Problems with Pearson residuals

-   Actual residuals typically:

    -   Not normal

    -   Not independent

-   In addition, we really want to look at residuals in some sense integrated over random effects, rather than at the best estimates of random effects

## Solutions: OSA = Recursive quantile residuals:  

-   The capability is built into RTMB and in theory can be applied almost automatically: oneStepPredict(obj) - with data set up using OBS

-   Numerically intensive and can be numerically tricky.

-   The theory underlying this is pretty intense. See:

Thygesen et al. Environ Ecol Stat 24(2): 317--339.

-   I have not gotten this working for multinomial.
-   Near automatic approach relies on TMB/RTMB understanding the density functions you are using.

## Checking on the Laplace approximation

-   Approximation depends on approximate normality of the combined vector or parameter estimates and random estimates.

-   This is why we generally don't specify non-normal distributions for random effects.

-   RTMB includes a helper function that checks the Laplace approximation call as: checkConsistency(obj)

    -   Requires you have set up your function for simulation (using OBS) (and the simulations work!)
