## Changes post course period

This file flags substantive changes to materials on GitHub site made after the course offering in December 2023 through to the next time this course is offered. At that time it will likely be removed as the material may change substantially in preparation for a new offering. It is arranged chronologically when the changes have been made, so if you have reviewed changes in the past you can just go down to that point and look for newer additions.

## December 17 changes

-   R script added to lesson 6 showing REML applied to simple NL regression and showing that the REML procedure produces the known approximately unbiased
variance estimate.  Slide added for this.
-   checkConsistency expanded to two slides and indicates preferred approach of running with "estimate=True"
