## Evolving list of examples (check again)

-   Age comp data
    -   multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial
-   Multivariate normal data
-   Correlated random effects for vonB model
-   Other undocumented examples

## Age comp example

-   Constant recruitment and survival (necessary in example because the only type
    of data being used is age comps).

-   Initially we assume we have good prior estimates of recruitment and assume
    they are known.

    -   Alternatives

        -   Estimate selectivity for each age forced to increase monotonically

        -   Estimate selectivity via a logistic function

-   multiple samples of age composition. Initially assumed to be multinomial,
    then Dirichlet multinomial

## Model

$$
\begin{array}{c}N_{a}=R \exp (-Z(a-r)), r \leq a \leq \max \\C_{i, a}=q_{i} S_{a} N_{a} \\p_{a}=\frac{S_{a} N_{a}}{\sum_{j=r}^{\max } S_{j} N_{j}} \\\underline{n}_{i} \sim \operatorname{multinom}\left(n_{i}, \underline{p}_{a}\right), n_{i}=\sum_{a=r}^{a=\max } n_{i, a}\end{array}
$$

## Setting effective sample size

-   Multinomial apps often use data as proportions and "effective sample size"
    (ESS)

-   In such applications the negative log likelihood was written in terms of
    proportions and ESS

-   In RTMB emulate by providing dmultinom product of proportions and ESS as the
    data (don't set size!)

    -   The NLL returned will depend on the ESS but ESS cannot be estimated
        (nothing new for multinomial here)

    -   Works because the internal dmultinom calcs allow non-integers.

## Dirichlet-Multinomial

-   Compound distribution, p vector comes from dirichlet then used as parameter
    of of multinomial.

-   Used to introduce overdispersion relative to multinomial

-   Using linear form where ESS proportional to sample size

$$
\begin{array}{c}\underline{n}_{i} \sim \operatorname{DirMult}\left(n_{i}, \underline{\alpha}_{i}\right), \alpha_{i, a}>0 \\E\left(n_{i, a}\right)=n_{i} \frac{\alpha_{i, a}}{\sum_{j} \alpha_{i, j}}, E S S_{i}=\sum_{a} \alpha_{j, a} \\\alpha_{i, a}=\theta n_{i} p_{a}, E S S_{i}=\theta n_{i}\end{array}
$$

## Multivariate Normal Distribution with unstructured var-cov matrix

-   Parameterize so that standard deviations and correlations can be calculated
    and converted into a variance-covariance matrix

-   Estimate the standard deviations on log-scale

-   Not sufficient to restrict correlations to -1 to 1 as some combinations of
    correlations are not consistent with feasible correlation matrices

    -   e.g., if *a* and *b* are highly negatively correlated, you can't have *c*
        highly positively correlated with a and highly negatively correlated with
        *b*

## Converting SDs and correlation matrix to a var-cov matrix

-   Typical element of correlation matrix P is
    $\rho_{i,j} = \sigma_{i,j}^{2}/(\sigma_{i,i}\sigma_{j,j})$

    -   $\sigma_{i,j}^2$ is a typical element of the variance-covariance matrix,
        with $\sigma_{i,j}^2=\rho_{i,j}\sigma_{i,i}\sigma_{j,j}$

-   Matrix algebra to convert correlation matrix and SDs to var-cov matrix

$$
\Sigma=\operatorname{diag}\left(\sigma_{1,1}, \cdots, \sigma_{k, k}\right) \mathrm{P} \operatorname{diag}\left(\sigma_{1,1}, \cdots, \sigma_{k, k}\right)
$$

## Motivation for being able to deal with unstructured MVN

-   You might actually want to assume some data are multivariate normal (e.g.,
    some catch-at-age assessments assume log of catch-at-age MVN). But often we
    impose structure on correlations.

-   You might want to allow different random effects to be correlated. E.g., we
    might expect the vonB function parameters for a pond will be either
    positively or negatively correlated with one another.

-   Illustrate with another very simple example

## Simple application of unstructured multivariate normal

-   We have a set of multivariate observations assumed to come from a
    multivariate normal distribution

-   We estimate the mean vector and parameters that determine the
    variance-covariance matrix

    -   Illustrate how to estimate parameters on real number line that determine
        a "legal" correlation matrix

    -   Illustrate how to get the variance-covariance matrix from correlation
        matrix and vectors of standard deviations

    -   See "unstructured" example R script

## Correlated random effects for vonB model

-   We have already seen how to make a vonB parameter a random effect. We could
    have made more than one parameter random at the same time using dnorm

    -   This assumes the random effects are independent but often that is not
        plausible \[when fish ultimately get big (Linf) they might approach
        asymptotic size more slowly (K)\].

-   We can implement this by having the vonB parameters follow a multivariate
    normal distribution

-   Larger and more realistic example data set, reparameterized the vonB (use L2
    rather than t0)

## New growth data set

-   20 different ponds

-   Each observation gives the pond ID and the length and age for an individual
    fish

## Reparameterized vonB

-   This is not changing the underlying growth function just how it is
    parameterized

-   Standard parameterization has been criticized for t0 being hard to interpret
    and for correlation with other parameters

-   Use L2 (length at age 2) instead. Chose age within range of observed data

    $$
    L_a=\widetilde{L}_{2}+\left(L_{\infty}-\widetilde{L}_{2}\right) \exp (-K(a-2))
    $$

## The multivariate random effects model

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\underline{\omega}_i = \left[\log L \infty_{i}, \log K_{i}, \log \widetilde{L 2}_{i}\right]^{T} \sim M V N\left(\left[\overline{\log L \infty_{i}}, \overline{\log K_{i}}, \overline{\log \widetilde{L 2}}\right]^{T}, \Sigma\right)} \\L_{i, j} \sim N\left(\operatorname{vonb}\left(\underline{\omega}_{i}, a_{i, j}\right), \sigma_{L, i, j}^{2}\right) \\\sigma_{L, i, j}=\exp \left[\operatorname{int}+\operatorname{slp} * \operatorname{vonb}\left(\underline{\omega}_{i}, a_{i, j}\right)\right] \operatorname{vonb}\left(\underline{\omega}_{i}, a_{i, j}\right)\end{array}
$$
